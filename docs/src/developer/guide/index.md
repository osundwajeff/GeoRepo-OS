* **[Architecture:](./architecture.md)** - Here we outline the system architecture using ER Diagrams, Software Component Diagrams etc.
* **[Prerequisites:](./prerequisites.md)** - An overview of the software that needs to be installed before you can start. 
* **[Cloning:](./cloning.md)** - In this section we cover how to make a local working copy on your own machine. 
* **[IDE Setup:](./ide-setup.md)** - Here we walk through setting up your IDE. 
* **[Building:](./building.md)** - This covers tasks related to building the application so you can test it in your browser.
* **[Configuration:](./configuration.md)** - This covers standard configuration tasks that need to be done once the site is brought online.
