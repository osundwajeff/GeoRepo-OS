# Roadmap

Like most Open Source Software, this project is an ongoing work in progress.

This document outlines the various ongoing activities and critical changes 
expected to be introduced.

## Future plans

- New types of 'modules' e.g. schools, healthcare facilities etc.

The current **main** branch is under heavy development and should be considered
unstable.
