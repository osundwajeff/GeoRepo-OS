# GeoRepo

GeoRepo is a UNICEF’s geospatial web-based data storage and administrative boundary harmonization platform. This data is uploaded to GeoRepo and managed as Reference Datasets. In turn, these datasets are utilized and displayed on the GeoSight data analysis/visualization platform.


## Key Concepts

**Datasets**, also known as Reference Datasets, are groupings that contain instances of administrative boundaries for specific countries or regions. Users can upload and organise versions of boundaries as they change over time. Subnational boundaries can be labelled according to the national boundary scheme.

**Views** are virtual datasets that can be isolated from larger areas to display specific data. Users can create country specific views from global or regional datasets.  Views can include all available versions of a reference dataset, or isolate specific versions of administrative boundaries.

The GeoRepo platform relies on accuracy and analysis of uploaded files to ensure that datasets are both harmonized and verified. When uploading data, GeoRepo will provide users with an error report highlighting inconsistencies such as overlaps between boundaries and the same boundary over successive versions.
